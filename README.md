Setting up SSH keys


See if existing SSH keys are present 
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

Generating new SSH keys
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
> Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM: [Press enter]
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```

Copying SSH keys to clipboard
```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Paste it into version control SSH settings

Test the SSH key
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Set remote origin
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git
```
